# Occupation Overview

1. Single page web app that uses mock data to give a detailed overview of a specific job occupation.  
2. I have made the components capable of being reusable so that different data can be presented as long as json structure is the same.
3. To use this app simply clone it and run npm install/yarn. After dependencies have been installed use npm run/yarn start.
